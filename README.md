# amazon-search-bar-fix
When you highlight the text in the search bar on Amazon.com and you drag too far to the left, it deselects the text field (this happens only in Chrome). This Chrome extension fixes that by reformatting it.

Download the files, go to chrome://extensions, enable dev mode, and click "load unpacked". Upload a folder containing the files.
